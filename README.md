- **Data Science & AI:** Proficient in PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Sklearn, and Matplotlib for machine learning and data analysis.  
- **Operating Systems:** Familiar with OS kernel concepts and low-level architecture.  

## Key Projects 📚  

### [Scalable Serveless Video Analysis Pipeline]()
- Designed a multi-stage serverless video analysis pipeline using **AWS Lambda** for processing 100+ videos.
- Built a video-splitting function with **FFmpeg** to extract frames, reducing processing overhead by 40%.
- Developed a face-recognition feature with **ResNet-34**, achieving 95% accuracy in identifying faces.
- Automated video upload, frame extraction, and object recognition using Lambda triggers.
  
### [Operating Systems Kernel Development]()
- Created a secure bootloader with SHA-256 and RISC-V PMP, improving boot integrity by 95%
- Implemented RISC-V trap-and-emulate virtualization, enabling seamless privilege transitions across U/S/M modes
- Optimized virtual memory management by integrating on-demand paging , reducing memory overhead by 35%
- Implemented the Working Set algorithm for page swapping in xv6, achieving up to 40% better memory utilization and 25% fewer page faults compared to FIFO

###[FlashBid - Super Fast Auction Platform](https://github.com/Akhash16/FlashBid):
-  Architected a real-time auction platform with Next.js, Supabase Auth, WebSockets & Tailwind/Shadcn/UI—delivering 300 ms bid responses, 99.5% uptime & 92+ Lighthouse scores
- Streamlined onboarding via multi-provider Supabase Auth (email, Google, social), cutting registration time 75% and reducing drop-offs 42%
  
### [Chart Application](https://github.com/Akhash16/Chart-Application)  
- Developed an interactive data visualization dashboard using **Next.js** for the frontend and **Django REST Framework** for the backend, providing various chart types like bar, line, and candlestick.  
- Integrated **Recharts** and **React-ApexCharts** libraries for enhanced charting features, along with responsive design and TypeScript for scalability and improved user experience.
